# Brewtender - A Homebrewer's RPG! #

## About
This game (in it's extremely early stages) is about foraging, business, making, and selling alcohol, all while trying to stay under the radar.
The idea is that you can forage or buy your brewing ingredients, and brew beers, wines, and ciders, or distill different types of alcohol.<br/>
Although not implemented yet, you will be able to sell your alcohol at your own set price, upgrade you equipment, all while keeping your reputation in line!<br/>
<br/>
<b>Please note</b> that I only have basic features implemented at the moment: movement, basic dialogue, stats and foraging, inventory, etc. As I am learning as I go!
<br/><br/><br/>
I <b>DO NOT</b> condone the selling of alcohol illegally nor do I do condone illegally distilling or underage drinking. Never drink and drive.
